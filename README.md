# A script for Discord board monitoring and pings
## Environment Variables
- BOT_TOKEN
- JOB_POST_CHANNEL_ID
- JOB_PINGS_CHANNEL_ID
- SERVER_ID

## Deployment
Deploy as a serverless function and set up scheduler to invoke it periodically with your favorite tools
This example is using [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [AWS EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/)

### Use AWS Lambda for hosting
https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/
#### Option 1:
1. Download or clone the src, including index.mjs, package.json. 
2. Run `npm install` (or whatever package manager you use).
3. Zip index.mjs, node_modules, package.json and the lock-file generated by package manager.
4. Upload to AWS Lambda

#### Option 2:
Set up github workflow with AWS access keys (github secret):
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION

And then make sure the lambda function name is consistent from github workflow to AWS Lambda,
Then lambda function will get updated after every push to main.

### Use AWS EventBridge for scheduling
https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/
